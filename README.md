# Autotrans

This is a python implementation of the
[autotrans](https://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/slref/modeling-an-automatic-transmission-controller.html)
model developed in Simulink by MathWorks. Communication with the MATLAB/Simulink
engine from python can be very slow and this project is an attempt to resolve
for projects which may need to run this model many times. This project was built
using a comprehensive test suite that compares the output of the python modules
with traces generated by the Simulink version to ensure that the behavior is
identical between both implementations.

## Installation

This project is availabe on PyPI and can be installed using the
command `pip install autotrans-py`.

## Usage

This module exports the `simulate` method which accepts two traces representing
the throttle and brake inputs, as well as an optional integration step size, and
returns a trace representing the state of the model at each time-step.
Additionally, the `Autotrans` class can be imported and instantiated directly,
and the state of the model can advanced using the `step` method.

The default integrator for the model is a fixed-step RK5 integrator. Other
integrators can be provided to the `simulate` method or when constructing
the `Autotrans` instance to customize the integration behavior.
